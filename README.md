Python OOPs practice: all these files are created using vscode

What is :
import os
os.system('cls')

When we run any python program in vscode ,it runs on terminal and if you're running more than one time then it looks little mess in your python terminal, but you can freely remove these lines feel free to do that :)

    To delete this ,just clear the line called "import clearterm"
